# AgeofAcquisitionExploration

While researching metrics for automatic text simplification, I found myself pondering the Flesch-Kincaid grade level. 
The number of syllables in a word has always seemed like a poor proxy for the difficulty of a word. I wondered if
age of acquisition might be a better indicator of a word's reading level. I used age of acquisition data compiled by 
Victor Kuperman and Hans Stadthagen-Gonzalez to check for correlation between age of acquisition and number of
syllables. My hypothesis was that if the variables correlated well, it indicated they both reflected an underlying
reality (word difficulty). If not, they reflected different things, and age of acquisition might contribute a 
valuable dimension to future word grade level metrics.
